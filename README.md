Creates cfg files for optimum crt-pi shader appearence. Works only for lr-fbalpha (FBA 0.2.97.39), lr-mame2003 (MAME 0.78) and consoles (currently only Nestopia/NES).

Params are:
* core (currently, mame2003, fbalpha or consoles)
* screen width (eg 1920)
* screen height (eg 1080)

Example usage:
Clone into a directory, and then navigate to that directory in your command prompt, and then:

```python crt_pi_configs.py mame2003 1920 1080```

It will generate the cfgs and zip files containing the same in the root.

Compatible with Python 2.7 (retropie default) and upwards.
